! before changing what any modifier is they must be removed
remove control = Control_L

! Map right alt to control
keycode 108 = Control_L

! Map caps lock to escape
keycode 66 = Escape

! add them back? I don't know, seems to work
add control = Control_L

! keycode 66 = Escape
! 66 is caps lock
! 108 is Right alt
! 9 is Escape

! Using keycode instead of keysym because that seems to be the only way to make this file idempotent
! When mapping one modifier to another, xmodmap man says you must first unmap it from its original modifier map so it is not in the two different modifier lists
! mod1, lock and control are modifier maps meant for Alt, Caps Lock, and Control modifiers respectively. Run xmodmap to see the maps and which modifiers are bound to them.
