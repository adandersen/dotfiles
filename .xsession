# This file is needed when using a login manager such as gdm with fedora, as gdm doesn't invoke .bash_profile by default. 
# See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles in the "X sessions" area and search for gdm.

# -r means file exists and is readable
[ -r ~/.bash_profile ] && source ~/.bash_profile

# gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.keyboard delay 150
