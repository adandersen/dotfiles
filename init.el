;; Emacs key notation to know what to type for a given key -- https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsKeyNotation

;; keymap info -- https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/mastering-key-bindings-emacs
;; Keymap ordering preference lookup order from first to last:
;;   emulation-mode key map `emulation-mode-map-alists' (e.g. evil mode keybindings)
;;       > minor-mode-overrides key map `minor-mode-overriding-map-alist' (overrides any minor mode key-maps)
;;       > minor-mode key map `minor-mode-map-alist'
;;       > local buffer key map `current-local-map' (local buffer key map is generally populated by major-mode bindings)
;;       > global map `current-global-map'
;; In order to bind a function to a key, the function must be declared as a command, i.e. one that has the (interactive...) statement at the top of the function. The function also must take no parameters when used as a key binding, and if you want to pass arguments, it must be wrapped in a helper function, such as a lambda expression or a defun.

;; evaluations: lists and symbols are evaluated immediately, and therefore must generally be quoted if you want to pass the symbol or list into a function instead of its evaluation. If the symbol contains another symbol as a value, then you might not want to quote it to evaluate to the other symbol. Everything else delays evaluation.
;; To quote: 'x is to quote the symbol (variable) x. (quote x) is equivalent. A list is quoted e.g. '(1 2 3). If not quoted the list would evaluate trying to call the first argument 1 as a function. Every symbol has a "name" cell, a "value" cell, a "function" cell, and a "properties" cell. Use symbol-* functions to access the various cells for a given symbol.
